# MS2 Project for Code Institute 2020

## Overview
A retro-style game app build using JavaScript, HTML and CSS

[Live Demo:] (https://gisellenessi.github.io/Memory-Game/)

Memory game app features two games, first being a simple memory card game where the user can find the match over two cards at the time, you can win by finding all the matches.
The second game features the classic Simon, the game board has instructions on how to play including sound and colour sequences as the user plays. Both games keep count of the score while play and the app has an option to refresh both games to start over again.

The idea of this project is to provide a simple game app for kids and adults to enjoy a break and exercise the brain by playing memory games. This app has the potential to expand and add several more games to create a library of retro style memory games for users.

### Target audience
The target audience for this game app is game lovers, kids and adults interested in playing a quick and fun game while enjoying a break or leisure time. The app can be enjoyed by most people as comes with a set of rules to play the games and it doesn’t require the previous experience. A user looking to exercise their memory muscle can also enjoy playing this game on a regular basis.

## UX
This project recreates the classic games of memory card and Simon in a modern a retro-style single page application.

In order to make the user experience as easy as possible as well as fun I decided for a simple Single-Page Applications that includes a header introduction, a navigation menu, refresh button to start a new game, footer with contact information, all this easy an accessible for the user to interact with the app.

## Deployment
The game app is designed in VS code environment and regularly committed to Github after each important piece of code and changes.

To deploy the project to Github repository the following steps were taken:
Created master branch in Github repository
Used Local VS code environment to code and build the site
Committed files to the staging area using zhs terminal commands: git status, add (specify directory), git commit -m “add message”
Pushed files to working environment using git push, which updates the repository, it’s also viable as a link (link to GitHub) for cloning, testing on any device and screens.
Published site from master branch using settings tab in the main page of the repository, select source as master branch, then save.
Github pages
The repository can be cloned by clicking Clone or Download on the main page of the repository
In the clone with HTTP section, click the click board icon to copy the URL for the repository
